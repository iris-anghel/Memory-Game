# Memory Game

Project 4 - [Front-End Web Developer Nano Degree with Udacity & Google](https://eu.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001)

## Project overview

* Memory Game is a browser-based card matching game.

### How to play

The game board consists of 16 cards arranged randomly in a grid. Each card has a  different symbol (there are 8 hidden pairs). The goal is to match all cards.

The player can flip over only two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match. 
If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over. 
If the cards do not match, both cards are returned to their initial hidden state.

Above the deck, the following information is displayed:

   * a star rating
   * the number of moves the user has made
   * a timer 
   * a button to reset the game

When The game ends, a modal pops up with game stats:

   * number of moves they made
   * time to complete the game
   * star rating
   * the option to replay game or close modal
